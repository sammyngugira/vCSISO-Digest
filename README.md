<B>What is a vCISO?</B></br>

A vCISO (Virtual Chief Information Security Officer) is an outsourced or fractional security executive who provides strategic cybersecurity leadership to an organization delivering the expertise of a traditional CISO without the full-time cost and commitment.
Instead of hiring a full-time CISO (which can be very expensive), businesses bring in a vCISO on-demand, part-time, or retainer basis to oversee and strengthen their security program.
